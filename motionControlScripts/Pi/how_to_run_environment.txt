This installation requires some things (MotorKit) to be run in a virtual environment.

NOTE: May no longer be necessary now that we're using a motor controller instead of the MotorKit hat.

You must execute: 'source env/bin/activate' from the command line before 
running any script which uses MotorKit.
Do this from the home directory (must have access to env folder)
Then you may change to the project directory.
